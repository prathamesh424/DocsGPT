# LLM Document Analysis by [LexEU](https://www.lexeu.ai/) Competition

## üèÜ Competition Details:

Welcome to the LLM Document Analysis by [LexEU](https://www.lexeu.ai/) competition, part of Hacktoberfest! This challenge is designed for participants who can devise the best new retrieval or workflow method to analyze a document using EU laws.

### üèÖ Prizes:
- **1st Place:** $200 + Special Holopin
- **2nd Place:** $100 + Special Holopin
- **3rd Place:** $50 + Special Holopin
- **Top 3 Winners:** Special Holopin

### üìÜ Timeline:
- **Competition Announcement:** 1st October
- **Deadline for Submissions:** 8th November
- **Results Announcement:** Early November

## üìú How to Participate:

Participants are required to analyze a given test contract by scraping EU law data, storing it in a database, and retrieving only the relevant portions for analysis. The solution must be optimized for efficiency, using a maximum of 500k tokens.

### Steps to Participate:

1. **Download Test Contract:** You can download it via this [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/198d7gFJbVWttkIS9ZRUs_PTKIjhsOUeR/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=107667025862106683614&rtpof=true&sd=true).
2. **Ingest EU Law Data:** Gather and store data in any format, it's available [here](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/browse/directories/legislation.html?displayProfile=lastConsDocProfile&classification=in-force).
3. **Optimized Data Retrieval:** Implement methods to retrieve only small, relevant portions of the law data for efficient analysis of the test contract. Try to create a custom retriever and a parser.
4. **Analyze the Contract:** Use your optimized retrieval method to analyze the test contract against the EU law data.
5. **Submission Criteria:** Your solution will be judged based on:
   - Amount of corrections/inconsistencies found
   - Number of tokens used (Maximum 500k tokens)
   - Your submission should be a fork of DocsGPT where all the ingestion and analysis steps can be replicated

### Submission Instructions:

1. **Submit Your Work:** Once you finish your analysis, submit your solution by filling out this [form](https://airtable.com/appikMaJwdHhC1SDP/pagLWdew2HKpEaBKr/form).
2. **Private Test Contract:** Your solution will also be benchmarked against a private test contract to validate its efficiency and effectiveness.
3. **Evaluation:** The winners will be evaluated based on the effectiveness of their solution in identifying corrections/inconsistencies and the number of tokens used in the process.

### Resources:

- **Documentation:** Refer to our [Documentation](https://docs.docsgpt.cloud/) for guidance.

- Try looking at existing [retrievers](https://github.com/arc53/DocsGPT/tree/main/application/retriever) and maybe creating a custom one
- Try looking at [worker.py](https://github.com/arc53/DocsGPT/blob/main/application/worker.py) which ingests data and creating a custom one for ingesting EU law
